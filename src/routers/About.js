With the technology transfer scheme that the government of Kuwait had opted for; we initiated a long-term business plan to develop strong alliances with international companies for streamlining future projects in Kuwait. Our most notable relationship was established in 1996, with ITOCHU Corporation, a Japanese trading house, and this relationship developed into a very close strategic alliance for mutual business interests in Kuwait. This was further enhanced by establishing a long-term association with Tekfen Construction & Installation Company, and an agency agreement was signed in 2005 with Tekfen in Kuwait.
Our parent company, Khalil Mahmoud Trading & Contracting Est. (KME) was established in 1953, primarily as a civil engineering and construction company, and has been classified as a Grade II contractor by the Central Tenders Committee since 1971 for civil construction and electrical works, which is the highest category given to local contractors working in Kuwait as category I is for international contractors. KME is best known for developing the State of Kuwaitâ€™s tenth district (Cities of Fahaheel, Ahmadi, Sabahiya, Mangaf, AbuHalifa, Fintas) by the construction of housing & commercial projects as well as relevant municipal infrastructure. In addition, KME pioneered the development of farming and mass agricultural production in Kuwait by implementing horticultural farming in the Wafra area.
